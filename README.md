## How to use this code

### Dependencies
1. ROS Indigo (with catkin, std_msgs, tf packages installed)
2. sbpl package (installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/sbpl/sbpl))

### Building
1. Clone the repo into your catkin workspace
2. Go to the catkin workspace root directory and then run `catkin_make`

### Running the executable
1. The executable can be run using `rosrun sbpl_dynamic_adaptive_planner test_ad_exact [env_file] [motprim_file] [dynObsFile]`
2. For example, in the root directory it can be run as `rosrun sbpl_dynamic_adaptive_planner test_ad_exact env/test1_indoor.exp env/unicycle_noturninplace.mprim env/dynObs1_indoor_30.dob`
3. You can visualize the resulting path and the environment by running RViz using the `rviz/visualization.rviz` config file
